Learn about tools used to analyse flaws in software systems, necessary knowledge to build secure software systems (esp. within Web), the skills needed to perform risk and threat analysis on existing systems and the relevant legislation within EU.

Here, we also introduce the basics of internet communication protocols and a gentle introduction to cryptography.

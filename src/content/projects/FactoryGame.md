## Tower defense/Factory mobile game

### Description

A mobile game meant to be enjoyed on the go and at home as well

A part tower defense part base building game. The main game would take place in the base of the user and the missions would have been a tower defense mission to collect the resources needed to build the base. 

### Progress

The game, at the time of leaving, was in a state that it would have been at the stage to start devloping the tower defense and base building phase.

I had worked on the UI for the most part of my time and was starting to work on the building aspect of the game.

The game is being worked on by another programmer as of 18.1.2023

### Problems

Well the biggest problems I had while working on the project happened to mostly be the fact that I was working alone. I had no real experience working on unity, but I was able to make use of vidoes found on YouTube to create something that, while no proud of, was still satisfied with the outcome.

#### Conclusion

While I may have not worked on the project for a long time, I was still able to learn something about Unity as well as my passions. In the future I will be working on projects that I, not only find to be more interesting than a mobile game, but also projects that I enjoy working on.

I will also be working with a bigger team than me, myself and I, to divide the work and work more efficiently

### Description

A very simple portfolio that I use/used during my time at XAMK. It holds all the same projects as this portfolio.

### Progress

The portfolio came to be very easily. I started working on it during some evening and didn't stop until I had everything that I needed for it.

### Problems

Didn't really encounter any problems. I stayed within my repertoire of skills and was done with the portfolio in no time. I have since been updating it regularily.

#### Conclusion

It was a fun and small project that we had to do for a course. I was pleased with it and didn't really see a need to go over-board with it.
